<img src="https://github.com/johnnydevster/readme_gifs/blob/main/delidelights/1%20-%20Main.gif" alt="scrolling through deli delights fake restaurant webside">

#### :clipboard: My main purpose with this project 

* Learn how **Server Side Rendering** works through Next.js
* Learn how to use WordPress as a **headless CMS**
* Learn more about **GraphQL-queries**
* Learn how to use **Dynamic Routes** using slugs fetched through queries

#### :grey_question: Why headless WordPress?
The reasoning behind using WordPress as a headless CMS was that I wanted the hypothetical client (i.e the store owner / administrator) to easily be able to add / edit content on the site through WordPress' admin panel, while me as the developer can still retain full control over the front end presentation.

Also, because I still need to practice my CSS chops and didn't want to cheat with a WYSIWYG editor. :eyes:
